/*
 * 7. Write a function called bitpat_get() to extract a specified set of bits.
 * Have it take three arguments: the first an unsigned int, the second an
 * integer starting bit number, and the third a bit count. Using the convention
 * that bit numbering starts at 0 with the leftmost bit, extract the specified
 * number of bits from the first argument and return the result. So the call
 *
 *		bitpat_get (x, 0, 3)
 *
 * extracts the three leftmost bits from x. The call
 *
 *		bitpat_get (x, 3, 5)
 *
 * extracts five bits starting with the fourth bit in from the left.
